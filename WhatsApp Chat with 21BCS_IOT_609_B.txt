Why Choose Us:

Double Impact: By being part of both projects, you can leverage your skills to influence both the government and student media landscapes simultaneously.
Skill Diversification: Working on two distinct projects will allow you to enhance your skills across different domains, adding depth to your experience.
Networking: Collaborating with diverse teams, including government officials and media professionals, will expand your network significantly.
Recognition: Your contributions will be acknowledged in two influential spheres, boosting your profile and opening doors for future opportunities.
Next Steps:
We invite you to consider joining both projects to embark on a journey of dual impact. If you're intrigued and excited by the prospect, please register on this link https://forms.gle/CsCoJwZ25TTfp8CQ8 or scan this QR code, and we'll arrange a discussion to delve deeper into the projects' details, your roles, and answer any questions you may have.

IMPORTANT POINTS:
1) Make sure that Faculties are required to give this task or assign these projects to each and every student in their respective Practical Labs.
2) Whatever the topic of our Tenth lab practical, it will be broken down into 15-15 marks, of which 15 will be for the lab itself, and the remaining 15 marks will be based on Mini Projects.

PRACTICAL 10TH (30 Marks)
PRACTICAL  (15 Marks)	MINI PROJECT (15 Marks)
CONDUCT      (4 MARKS)	VIVA        (8 Marks)	WORKSHEET (3 Marks)	PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  (5 Marks) 	PROJECT VIVA (5 Marks) 	PROJECT REPORT       (5 marks)

3) Students may create three-person teams, and those who prefer work alone can do so.
4) Ask students to go through the Mini Project Report Format. The report will have a minimum of 20 pages and should be spiral bound.
5) Also ensure that the teacher will monitor the Progress of the Mini Projects  in their respective  labs.
6) It is mandatory for each and every student to submit the project  before 10th November, 2023, no excuses will be considered after that.

9/5/23, 8:22 PM - +91 83038 16984: Dear CR
In case you will receive message from students regarding fee and detain issue:
1) first solution is that you are detainee due to no fee payment- fee payment is required to give exam. Deposit your fee take slip from account office and show the slip to exam center where you are having exam- they will allow to give exam if all dues will be clear .

2) if full fee paid still showing detainee—- check account balance sheet on cuims in fee payment tab , status of fee payment is mot updated . Either ask account department to clear  status if not uodated till morning or you can directly show fee slip to exam center where you are having exam.

3) if loan cases are there ask them to visit loan department and egov and discuss issue with them and take permission
